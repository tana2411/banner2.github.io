            <h1>Always Complaining About This Big, Big World</h1>
            <p>Apple's AirPods are awesome and have <a href="google.com">some amazing features</a>, but they're pretty
                much the same size and design as EarPods. EarPods hurt (at least for some of us). So, it stands to
                reason that AirPods would, too — except they don't ... mostly.</p>

                    always complains about how big things don't fit me right. I've got small hands. I've got thin
                    wrists. My feet are little. I might be giving you an incorrect image of my size. I'm not actually

                <p>I'm guessing that's why Apple's EarPods have always felt so uncomfortable to me. It must be that my
                    ear canal is also smaller than average. The EarPods are hard, with absolutely no padding, so they
                    cause me a lot of pain if I wear them for too long. I'll sometimes end up with a headache. So, when
                    Apple announced the new AirPods, I was both excited and disappointed.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sound quality: Generally speaking, you get better sound from over-ears, although at the
                            higher prices, there are amazing in-ears, too.</li>
                        <li>Comfort: You don’t have to stick anything in your ears.</li>
                        <li>Not blocking you in: Open-backed headphones let ambient sound in (and your music out). This
                            is good if you don’t want to feel blocked in, but can also be annoying for other people.
                            Also, useless in noisy places.</li>

            <h2>Its an Adjustment Period</h2>
            <p>Apple successfully turned what I consider to be an awkwardly designed in-ear audio device into something
                I enjoy wearing 90 percent of the time. If you're like me and find EarPods to be uncomfortable, and you
                haven't bought AirPods because you're worried about them hurting your ears, I can confidently say they
                are significantly more comfortable.</p>
